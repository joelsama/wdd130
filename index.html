                <p>Nigeria is a diverse and vibrant country located in West Africa. It is the most populous country on the continent,
                    with over 200 million people, and boasts a rich cultural heritage with over 500 ethnic groups, including the Yoruba,
                    Igbo, and Hausa. Nigeria is known for its vast natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas, which play a major
                    role in its economy. The country is also famous for its lively music and film industries, with Nollywood being one of the
                    largest film producers in the world. Despite facing challenges such as poverty and political instability, Nigeria remains a
                    dynamic and influential country in Africa and beyond.</p>
